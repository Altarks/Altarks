Hi, I'm @Altarks :D
I'm from Geneva Switzerland
I'm a computer scientist student in my second year at CFPT-I (Centre de Formation Professionnel Technique - Informatique).
I love playing video games, but making them is even cooler.  :)

I'm still a big noob, but it will come with time.  ^^
Here are some of the languages I know:
HTML-5 | CSS | JavaScript ♥ | PHP | C# ♥ | Python3 | SQL | Bash
<!--- JavaScript and C# are still the best :) --->
