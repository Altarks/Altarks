Hi, I'm @Altarks :D
I'm 16 years old and I'm from Geneva.
I'm a informatic student in my second year at CFPT-I (Centre de Formation Professionnel Technique - Informatique).
I love playing video games, but making them is even cooler. :)

I'm still a big noob, but it will come with time. ^^
Here are some of the languages I know:
HTML-5 | CSS | JavaScript ♥ | PHP | C# ♥ | Python3 | SQL | Bash
<!--- JavaScript and C# are still the best :) ---> 

You can reach me at hugomarty5@gmail.com
